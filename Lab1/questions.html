<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>
<p>Research the frequencies of the ISM bands, and describe where you would expect to find the signal, given the properties of radio waves at these particular and the typical use case of garage door opener. At which frequencies do you not expect to find the signal? Explain why.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/wireless-explainer/">link to answer?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A lot of the unlicensed stuff — for example, Wi-Fi — is on the 2.4-GHz or the 900-Mhz frequencies, the ISM bands. You don’t need a license to operate on them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>Analyze the signal in the time and frequency domain, and describe your observations. What can you conclude about the signal’s modulation? Record the frequency and bandwidth of the signal for later processing.</p>
<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>
<p>Demodulate the signal based on the modulation type you identified earlier and study the signal. What information is transmitted by the garage door remote?</p>
<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>
<p>Compare each of the transmissions, describe how does the protocol of the wireless remote works. What triggers the garage door to open and close?</p>
<h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>
<p>Assemble a signal that is able to open the garage door and transmit it. Ensure that the “garage door” opens.</p>
<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>
<p>Describe the weakness of the garage door opener protocol. How would you change the communication protocol so that the basic signal injection you have just done would no longer be successful? What would be necessary for the designers to accomplish this. Aside from the cryptographic and network- security related aspects, also comment on usability aspects of your proposed solution.</p>
<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>
<p>Given the chart, estimate the beamwidth of the an- tenna. What range extension would you expect in boresight?</p>
<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>
<p>Plot a chart of distance versus signal strength ob- served by the SDR. Mark when the garage door stops to react to the signals sent by the remote. When can the SDR no longer receive and decode the transmission? Mark this threshold in the chart as well.</p>
<h3 id="question-9">Question 9</h3>
<p>Based on the approximate receiver sensitivity of the garage door, estimate from how far away an adversary could successfully observe and inject a signal only based on antenna gain.</p>
